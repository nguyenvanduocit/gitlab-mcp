# GitLab MCP

A Go-based MCP (Model Control Protocol) connector for GitLab that enables AI assistants like Claude to interact with GitLab repositories and projects. This tool provides a seamless interface for AI models to perform comprehensive GitLab operations through natural language.

## WHY

While GitLab provides various API integrations, our MCP implementation offers **superior AI-native interaction and comprehensive workflow management**. We've built this connector to address the real challenges developers and project managers face when working with GitLab through AI assistants.

**Key Advantages:**
- **Comprehensive GitLab Integration**: Full access to projects, merge requests, pipelines, commits, and user management
- **AI-Optimized Interface**: Designed specifically for natural language interactions with AI assistants
- **Real-World Workflow Focus**: Built to solve actual daily problems like code review, CI/CD monitoring, and project management
- **Enhanced Productivity**: Seamless integration allowing AI to help with GitLab operations without context switching
- **Developer-Friendly**: Tools designed for actual development workflows, not just basic API calls

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need:
1. **GitLab Account** with access to your GitLab instance (GitLab.com or self-hosted)
2. **Personal Access Token** from GitLab (we'll help you get this)
3. **Cursor IDE** with Claude integration

### Step 1: Get Your GitLab Personal Access Token

1. Go to your GitLab instance ‚Üí **User Settings** ‚Üí **Access Tokens**
2. Click **"Add new token"**
3. Give it a name like "GitLab MCP Connector"
4. Select scopes: `api`, `read_user`, `read_repository`
5. Set expiration date (optional)
6. Click **"Create personal access token"**
7. **Copy the token** (you won't see it again!)

### Step 2: Choose Your Installation Method

We recommend **Docker** for the easiest setup:

#### üê≥ Option A: Docker (Recommended)

```bash
# Pull the latest image
docker pull ghcr.io/yourusername/gitlab-mcp:latest

# Test it works (replace with your details)
docker run --rm \
  -e GITLAB_HOST=https://gitlab.com \
  -e GITLAB_TOKEN=your-personal-access-token \
  ghcr.io/yourusername/gitlab-mcp:latest
```

#### üì¶ Option B: Download Binary

1. Go to [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/yourusername/gitlab-mcp/releases)
2. Download for your platform:
   - **macOS**: `gitlab-mcp_darwin_amd64`
   - **Linux**: `gitlab-mcp_linux_amd64`  
   - **Windows**: `gitlab-mcp_windows_amd64.exe`
3. Make it executable (macOS/Linux):
   ```bash
   chmod +x gitlab-mcp_*
   sudo mv gitlab-mcp_* /usr/local/bin/gitlab-mcp
   ```

#### üõ†Ô∏è Option C: Build from Source

```bash
go install github.com/yourusername/gitlab-mcp@latest
```

### Step 3: Configure Cursor

1. **Open Cursor**
2. **Go to Settings** ‚Üí **Features** ‚Üí **Model Context Protocol**
3. **Add a new MCP server** with this configuration:

#### For Docker Users:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gitlab": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run", "--rm", "-i",
        "-e", "GITLAB_HOST=https://gitlab.com",
        "-e", "GITLAB_TOKEN=your-personal-access-token",
        "ghcr.io/yourusername/gitlab-mcp:latest"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### For Binary Users:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gitlab": {
      "command": "/usr/local/bin/gitlab-mcp",
      "env": {
        "GITLAB_HOST": "https://gitlab.com",
        "GITLAB_TOKEN": "your-personal-access-token"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### For Self-Hosted GitLab:
Replace `https://gitlab.com` with your GitLab instance URL (e.g., `https://gitlab.yourcompany.com`)

### Step 4: Test Your Setup

1. **Restart Cursor** completely
2. **Open a new chat** with Claude
3. **Try these test commands**:

```
List my GitLab projects
```

```
Show me recent merge requests in my projects
```

```
What's the status of the latest pipeline?
```

If you see GitLab data, **congratulations! üéâ** You're all set up.

## üîß Advanced Configuration

### Using Environment Files

Create a `.env` file for easier management:

```bash
# .env file
GITLAB_HOST=https://gitlab.com
GITLAB_TOKEN=your-personal-access-token
```

Then use it:
```bash
# With binary
gitlab-mcp -env .env

# With Docker
docker run --rm -i --env-file .env ghcr.io/yourusername/gitlab-mcp:latest
```

### HTTP Mode for Development

For development and testing, you can run in HTTP mode:

```bash
# Start HTTP server on port 3000
gitlab-mcp -env .env -http_port 3000
```

Then configure Cursor with:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gitlab": {
      "url": "http://localhost:3000/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

## üéØ Usage Examples

Once configured, you can ask Claude to help with GitLab tasks using natural language:

### Project & Repository Management
- *"Show me all my GitLab projects"*
- *"Get the README file from the main branch of project X"*
- *"List all files in the src directory of repository Y"*
- *"What are the recent changes in project Z?"*

### Merge Request Operations
- *"Show me all open merge requests assigned to me"*
- *"What's the status of MR #123 in project ABC?"*
- *"List merge requests that need my review"*
- *"Show me the changes in the latest merge request"*

### Pipeline & CI/CD Monitoring
- *"What's the status of the latest pipeline in project X?"*
- *"Show me failed pipelines from the last week"*
- *"List all running pipelines across my projects"*
- *"Get details of pipeline #456 in project Y"*

### Development Insights
- *"Show me recent commits by author John"*
- *"What commits were made to the main branch today?"*
- *"List all commits with 'fix' in the message"*
- *"Show me user activity for the development team"*

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**‚ùå "Connection failed" or "Authentication error"**
- Double-check your `GITLAB_HOST` (should include https://)
- Verify your personal access token is correct and not expired
- Make sure your token has the required scopes (`api`, `read_user`, `read_repository`)

**‚ùå "No MCP servers found"**
- Restart Cursor completely after adding the configuration
- Check the MCP configuration syntax in Cursor settings
- Verify the binary path is correct (for binary installations)

**‚ùå "Permission denied" errors**
- Make sure your GitLab account has access to the projects you're trying to access
- Check if your personal access token has the necessary permissions
- Verify you're using the correct GitLab instance URL

**‚ùå "Rate limit exceeded"**
- GitLab has API rate limits; wait a moment before retrying
- Consider using a more specific query to reduce API calls

### Getting Help

1. **Check the logs**: Run with `-http_port` to see detailed error messages
2. **Test your credentials**: Try the Docker test command from Step 2
3. **Verify Cursor config**: The app will show you the exact configuration to use
4. **Check GitLab permissions**: Ensure your token has access to the resources you need
